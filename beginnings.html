                Napoleone Buonaparte was born, luckily, on the 15th of August
                1769 in Ajaccio on the small island of Corsica in the
                Mediterranean. Why luckily? Because the island had changed
                masters just the year before. After belonging to the Republic of
                Genoa, it was now France's. Had this not happened, who knows
                where fate would have guided the young Corsican? Surely, no one
                could have expected what heights this young man of Italian blood
                born in a modest noble family would reach.

                At the age of 9, due to his father's success in securing a royal
                grant to pay for his scholarship, the young Napoleon is sent on
                the mainland to commence his education. At school, he would
                experience mockery from his classmates regarding his Corsican
                accent and would often get into fights because of it. These
                experiences did not impede the young Napoleon from performing
                very well in class, especially in geography and mathematics. He
                was a very enthusiastic reader and could often be found reading
                about the lives of the great conquerors of history such as
                Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar or Frederick II.

                Bonaparte's first military feat can be traced all the way back
                to Toulon in the second half of 1793. The British and Spanish
                had taken control of the city and it was crucial that the French
                dislodge them from this strategic point from which their enemies
                could prepare and launch dangerous attacks. Although he didn't
                command the whole operation, the taking of Fort de l'Eguillette,
                an advantageous position from which the French artillery could
                bombard the British and Spanish ships, was his idea and the
                brilliance of it was immediately recognized by his superiors.

                After having saved the Republic from a royalist insurrection in
                Paris in September 1795, Napoleon Bonaparte was given the
                command of the Army of Italy in early 1796. It was both a great
                honour and a great responsabilty for someone who was still so
                young. Remember he was only 26 years old. It was hard to win
                over the hearts of the French soldiers who had been fighting for
                years already, but he managed it, with both his grandiose
                speeches and brave actions. After a magnificent two year
                campaign, he even succeeded in bringing down the hereditary
                rival of France: Austria.
