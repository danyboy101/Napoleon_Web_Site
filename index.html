          Was he a monstrous tyrant whose ambition and lust for power pushed him
          to go to war with all of Europe, bringing fear and death to the
          continent? Or was he rather the greatest hero of France who finally
          brought stabilty and prosperity to the nation after a decade of
          turbulence caused by the Revolution? To most people Napoleon Bonaparte
          is somewhere in the middle. Whatever one might think about him,
          however, it is undeniable that few men have had such a lasting impact
          on the world and the story of his life, of his rise to power from
          humble origins, of his wars against all of Europe can leave nobody
          cold and indifferent. He is mostly known for his military prowess and
          while he is undoubtedly the greatest military commander to have ever
          lived, there is much more to him than that. His iconic hat and posture
          with the hand hidden in the jacket is recognized internationally. One
          could discuss for hours his political visions, his ideas about society
          and the Revolution, all the different ways his defeats could have gone
          differently, his talent in enflamming the passion of his men or even
          his great eye for art and the grandiose. We hope to present here a
          taste of who Napoleon Bonaparte was and what he did after which you
          will hopefully have a new-found interest in the life of the Emperor of
          the French and learn more about his incredible life.
