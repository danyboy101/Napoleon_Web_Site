                His last battle. The last after a long series of glorious
                victories. It was also his last chance to
                establish himself and his dynasty as permanent rulers of France.
                In the evening of the 18th of June 1815, it seemed that the
                Emperor and his army had won the battle against the Duke of
                Wellington, up until Bl√ºcher and his Prussians arrived at the
                last second and caused the French to flee. Waterloo might still
                be a name which inspires much nostalgia to French hearts. Many
                poems, songs and books have been written about it in the
                nineteenth century. The memory of Waterloo is therefore hard to
                forget and the limits of 1815 are still the ones marking off
                the northern borders of France to this day.

                After waterloo, Napoleon surrendered himself to the British,
                thinking this would lead to an honourable end to his story. It
                wasn't exactly the case. The British authorities decided to
                exile him on the island of Saint Helena in the middle of the
                Atlantic Ocean where British troops were always present to keep
                an eye on him and prevent any attempt to escape. There Napoleon
                started a new kind of battle: the battle of the mind. His work
                was focused on rewriting his story to rehabilitate himself in
                the eyes of his countrymen and to pave the way for a new
                Bonaparte to sit on the throne of France one day...
